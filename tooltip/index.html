			<p><b>Most Outstanding Vanderbilt Memory:</b> It is nearly impossible to pick one, but the back steps of Memorial House have been the location of so many outstanding moments. Any night you can hold a s'more in one hand and be having a discussion about social justice or listening to an impromptu jam session, is an outstanding memory.

I will definitely leave Vanderbilt with a much more holistic perspective having lived and worked there with people I now consider friends. </p>

Being a part of a production that celebrated culture and the vibrancy of Vanderbilt in front of a thousand community members will remain one of the happiest memories of my life.</p>

			<p><b>Most Outstanding Vanderbilt Memory:</b> At the beginning of each show of VOB's Bloody, Bloody Andrew Jackson in Spring 2014, as the title character Andrew Jackson, I had to dance on an audience member in a way that was, to say the least, an invasion of personal space. Before opening night's show, I checked in with one of my friends in the front row to get her "ok" on being the (un)fortunate victim, but she still practically jumped out of her seat in shock when the time came. Although I don't necessarily enjoy terrifying people I love on a daily basis, as a performer and an extrovert, I'll never forget the thrill of having that level of engagement with the audience.</p>

The collaboration and energy of the Commons epitomize the Vanderbilt experience and I'm lucky to have been able to live that for (almost) four years, first as a resident, then as an RA, and now as an HR. I am so humbled that I've had the opportunity to live and learn with such incredible first-year students, who have taught me more about life than I could have ever taught them. Returning home to the Commons everyday is a constant reminder of why I love Vanderbilt. </p>

			<p><b>Most Outstanding Vanderbilt Memory:</b> This is impossible to narrow down, but one of my favorite memories while at Vanderbilt was when the Figure Skating Club hosted our first-ever event. A friend and I had started the club during my sophomore year, and although we had a small group of skaters practicing weekly, we wanted to do something that could involve our other friends and the rest of the campus. I was so nervous that we wouldn't be able to rent the rink, that people wouldn't come, or that no one would have fun, but we ended up getting over 50 people to come out to Centennial Sportsplex for a public skate session on a Saturday afternoon last fall. We had food, music, and so many more attendees than we ever thought possible, and it was an amazing realization of how supportive the Vanderbilt community is and how many people were willing to try something new. </p>

			<p><b>Most Outstanding Vanderbilt Memory:</b> Being a Vanderbilt student has provided me some of the most important and amazing opportunities of my life. Yet, my most impactful experiences on campus have come not from my own successes but rather moments of growth. Too often do students feel that if they do not hold particular titles or follow certain paths, then they cannot be “real people” or make a difference. So whether you have received a D on a general chemistry exam, sought much needed help at the PCC, or been turned down three times from VUcept (or even all three like me), know that you can create your own path and still be an outstanding and dynamic leader on this campus. In short, my mom has already said it best: “You will never regret being your kindest, most genuine self.” </p>

And that, to me, felt like a glimpse into the future of Vanderbilt. I've been lucky enough to have this campus and its diversity as the ultimate learning experience, and sharing that experience in a school-wide campaign was a dream come true. </p>
